# I commented everything above this, as I don't really need those. So everything above, is just merely code backup.

# Other files and folders
bin-debug\token.js

# Executables
cdn/newfile.txt
bin-release\token-obtainer.*

# Project files, i.e. `.project`, `.actionScriptProperties` and `.flexProperties`
# should NOT be excluded as they contain compiler settings and other important
# information for Eclipse / Flash Builder.
